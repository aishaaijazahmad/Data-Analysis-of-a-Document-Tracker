# Data-Analysis-of-a-Document-Tracker
The issuu.com platform is a website for publishing documents. It is widely used by many online publishers and currently hosts about 15 million documents. The web site tracks usage of the site and makes the resulting, anonymous data available to a wider audience. For example, it records who views a certain document, the browser used for viewing it, the way how the user arrived at this page etc. In this application, I have used one of these data sets to perform data processing and analysis in Python.
